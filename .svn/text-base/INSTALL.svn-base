Compiling:
===========
If you have all dependencies installed (see "Requirements" in README)
just run "cd build", "cmake ..", "make".

To en-/disable optional features just look at the top of CMakeList.txt.
comments are quite self explanatory.

There's also a cmake.sh script, which you might want to use.

Installation:
===============
just run "make install".

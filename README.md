# typhon-launcher
This is a mirror for typhon-launcher, which looks to have been abandoned by its original creator.
The plan of this repo is to attempt to maintain this project and get it working on modern linux distros.

More info in the "old" folder. (FYI: COPYING is basically LICENCE. You can ignore that.)

*I am still trying to figure things out, so things like the proper credits might be missing for a very short while.Sorry for that.(for now the original contributors are in old/AUTHORS)*

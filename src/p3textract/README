The code in here is mainly not written by me, but all of the parts 
are opensource, i.e. either GPL3 or public domain, as-is etc.

vag2wav was taken from http://psxsdk.googlecode.com/svn-history/r13/trunk/tools/vag2wav.c
license: http://psxsdk.googlecode.com/svn-history/r13/trunk/license.txt

most code from p3t.cpp and main.cpp was taken from
http://rebytes.ueuo.com/p3tbuilder.php
license: looks like public domain:
"You can use all source code and programs as you like. No need to give me regocnition or anything."

gim.cpp was written by my crazy friend harleaquin aka superdau -> http://www.superdau.de/
and is licensed under the GPL3.

Thank you all for your code!
